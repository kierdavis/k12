# K12

K12 is a project to design & build a working 8-bit CPU out of 7400-series TTL
logic gates.

## Current status

As of 29th July 2015, I am currently:

* building a prototype of the ALU board on breadboards
* working on a test setup (probably consisting of Arduinos & my FPGA dev board) that can be used to test the prototype
* implementing a model of the CPU in Verilog that can be used for simulation & testing

Things that have been done so far:

* design the architecture of the CPU
* draw out schematics for most of the CPU (ALU board, register board, control board, parts of the other boards)
* obtain some ICs & breadboards
